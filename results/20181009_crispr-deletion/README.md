# Summary

Plotting results of combination CRE knockout expression assays (both CRISPR-Cas9 compared to no guides, and the lentiviral Cas9).

Expression values for the CRISPR knockouts are normalized to the expression of the same condition without the guide.
Expression values for the lentiviral samples are normalized to the Chr14 (-) values.
