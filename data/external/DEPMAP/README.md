# Summary

This folder contains data from [DEPMAP](https://depmap.org/portal/download/).

Following from comments made by other lab members, instead of using the CCLE and Achilles data separately, we're using the combined and updated data versions from DEPMAP to calculate gene essentiality scores.

These files were downloaded from DEPMAP on 2018-12-19 (18Q4 versions).
See `config.csv` for the URLs.
